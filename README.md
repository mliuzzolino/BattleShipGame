# BattleShipGame

Game mode: Player vs. Computer

The game may be initialized one of two ways. First, the user may choose to enter the number and types of ships and their placements manually. Subsequently, the computer will randomly generate the same number and types of ships with random placement. Second, the user may choose to upload text files containing the ship type and placement data for the user and computer. 

Additional features: When one hit remains before the user's ship is sunk, you are given the option to abandon ship. Abandoning ship creates 2 new kayaks with a chance for surviving the debris field and sinks the original ship. Secondly, a simple search algorithm is implement for the CPU. That is, once a hit on the player's ship is logged, the computer will search the vicinity until the target ship is sunken.
